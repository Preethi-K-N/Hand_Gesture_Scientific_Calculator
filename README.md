## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

* **Python 3.9+**: The core programming language.
* **OpenCV (`opencv-python`)**: For real-time video capture, frame manipulation, and drawing the calculator UI.
* **MediaPipe Hands (`mediapipe`)**: A powerful framework for accurate hand landmark detection and tracking.
* **NumPy (`numpy`)**: Utilized for numerical operations, particularly in calculating distances between hand landmarks.
* **Python `math` Module**: Provides mathematical functions and constants for evaluating expressions.

## üß† **How It Works**

1.  **Hand Tracking**: MediaPipe detects 21 hand landmarks from webcam input.
2.  **Gesture-to-Click**: A "pinch" gesture (thumb-index tip proximity) is recognized as a button click.
3.  **UI Interaction**: The index finger's position during a pinch determines the selected calculator button.
4.  **Expression Processing**: Button presses update the display; pressing `=` triggers secure evaluation of the mathematical expression.
5.  **Dynamic Display**: OpenCV renders the calculator UI with real-time visual feedback (button highlighting).
6.  **Functionality**: Supports scientific calculations, angle mode toggling (radians/degrees), and memory operations, adapting behavior dynamically based on user input.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup and Execution**

### **Code Requirements**

* Python 3.9 or later
* A working virtual environment (`venv`) is highly recommended to manage dependencies.

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already from the main project):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Preethi-K-N/Hand_Gesture_Calculator-using_Normal_and_Scientific.git](https://github.com/Preethi-K-N/Hand_Gesture_Calculator-using_Normal_and_Scientific.git)
    cd Hand_Gesture_Calculator-using_Normal_and_Scientific
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the scientific calculator directory:**
    ```bash
    cd scientific_calculator
    ```
3.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
    ```

### **Running the Calculator**

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2.  **Execute the script:**
    ```bash
    python scientific_hand_gesture_calculator.py
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

* **`pinch_threshold`**: You might need to adjust the `pinch_threshold` variable in the `scientific_hand_gesture_calculator.py` script based on your webcam's distance, lighting conditions, and hand size to ensure optimal "pinch" detection.
* **Performance**: The performance can vary depending on your webcam quality and CPU capabilities.
* **Quit**: Press the `Esc` key to exit the calculator application at any time.
