## üí° **Overview**

This project transforms your webcam into an interactive input device for a scientific calculator. By simply performing a "pinch" gesture (bringing your thumb and index finger together), you can select buttons and input calculations. It supports a wide array of scientific functions, memory operations, and even angle mode toggling (radians/degrees).

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

* **Python 3.9+**: The core programming language.
* **OpenCV (`opencv-python`)**: For real-time video capture, frame manipulation, and drawing the calculator UI.
* **MediaPipe Hands (`mediapipe`)**: A powerful framework for accurate hand landmark detection and tracking.
* **NumPy (`numpy`)**: Utilized for numerical operations, particularly in calculating distances between hand landmarks.
* **Python `math` Module**: Provides mathematical functions and constants for evaluating expressions.

## üß† **How It Works**

1.  **Hand Landmark Detection**: MediaPipe processes the webcam feed to detect a single hand and pinpoint 21 key **landmarks** on it.
2.  **Gesture Recognition**: Specifically, it tracks the positions of the **Thumb Tip (ID 4)** and **Index Finger Tip (ID 8)**.
3.  **"Pinch" Detection**: The Euclidean distance between these two finger tips is continuously calculated. If this distance falls below a predefined `pinch_threshold`, it's registered as a "pinch" gesture, simulating a button click.
4.  **Button Interaction**: When a pinch is detected, the coordinates of the index finger tip determine which calculator button is being "pressed."
5.  **Expression Evaluation**: The `expression` string is updated based on button presses. When the `=` button is "clicked," the `calculate_expression()` function securely evaluates the mathematical string using a controlled `eval()` environment, preventing arbitrary code execution.
6.  **Dynamic UI**: The calculator interface, including buttons, display, and an icon, is drawn directly onto the video frame using OpenCV. Visual feedback (button highlighting) is provided on hover and click.
7.  **Angle Mode Handling**: Trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions dynamically adjust their behavior based on the `angle_mode` (radians or degrees), which can be toggled via a dedicated button.
8.  **Memory Functions**: `M+`, `M-`, `MR`, and `MC` buttons interact with a `memory` variable, allowing users to store and recall results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup and Execution**

### **Code Requirements**

* Python 3.9 or later
* A working virtual environment (`venv`) is highly recommended to manage dependencies.

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already from the main project):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Preethi-K-N/Hand_Gesture_Calculator-using_Normal_and_Scientific.git](https://github.com/Preethi-K-N/Hand_Gesture_Calculator-using_Normal_and_Scientific.git)
    cd Hand_Gesture_Calculator-using_Normal_and_Scientific
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the scientific calculator directory:**
    ```bash
    cd scientific_calculator
    ```
3.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
    ```

### **Running the Calculator**

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2.  **Execute the script:**
    ```bash
    python scientific_hand_gesture_calculator.py
    ```

*(Insert a screenshot or GIF of the scientific calculator UI in action here, similar to the original README's UI Preview)*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

* **`pinch_threshold`**: You might need to adjust the `pinch_threshold` variable in the `scientific_hand_gesture_calculator.py` script based on your webcam's distance, lighting conditions, and hand size to ensure optimal "pinch" detection.
* **Performance**: The performance can vary depending on your webcam quality and CPU capabilities.
* **Quit**: Press the `Esc` key to exit the calculator application at any time.
